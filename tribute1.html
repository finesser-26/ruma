            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">1924 </span>Sheikh Gumi was born in the village of Gummi now a local government area in Zamfara state on the last Friday of Ramadan in the Islamic year 1344, to the family of Mahmud, an Islamic scholar and Alkali (judge) of Gummi.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1929 </span>His education started within the walls of his family when he was a pupil of his father's Islamic teachings. He later sent to a school under the tutelage of a Malam called Musa at Ambursa, Sokoto province. There he was introduced to Fiqh and read books and praise poems on the prophet.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1933 </span>The first secular school he attended was the Dogondaji Primary School, while in the primary school, he met the future 18th Sultan of Sokoto, Ibrahim Dasuki and excelled in religious duties. He was made Hakimin Salla (leader of prayer) and was delegated responsibility for catering to the students religious activities.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1934 </span>He was transferred to the Sokoto Middle School, where Ahamdu Bello was teaching, there he was acquainted with Shehu Shagari, Waziri Muhammadu Junaidu, and Yahaya Gusau. After completing his studies at the middle school, he went to Kano to study Law and was trained as a Qadi. He started work as a scribe to Qadi Attahiru. He gave private lessons on Islam and tafsir as an escape from his disenchantment. He lost his father in 1937 while he was at the middle school. He got married 3 years later to maryam in 1941 when he was just 19.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1947 </span>Abubakar Gumi, left his job as secretary to Qadi Attahiru and went to teach at the Kano Law School, which he had previously attended. While in Kano, he met Sheik Sa'id Hayatu, a man widely considered one of the most prominent victims of colonial rule. Hayatu was the leader of the Mahdiyya movement and had just returned from a forced sojourn in Cameroon.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1949 </span>He took a teaching job at a school in Maru, Sokoto. The school had a famous tutor, Aminu Kano, who was the co-founder of the Northern Teachers Association and proprietor of a few Muslim schools. He left Maru to further his education at the school of Arabic Studies in Kano. On completion of his studies, he became a teacher for two years at the school. He also attended a school of education in Sudan.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1955 </span>Sheikh Gumi made his first pilgrimage to Mecca in 1955 and was joined in the journey by Ahmadu Bello. While in Mecca, he translated Islamic works in the company of Bello and King Sa'ud. He also met and befriended many members of the Ummah or Muslim community in Saudi Arabia, many of whom later became his benefactors after the death of Ahmadu Bello in 1966.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1957 </span>He became an interpreter for the Northern Nigeria government on Saudi Arabia matters.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1960 </span>By the late 1960s, after the death of Bello, Gumi's major Nigerian political support and moderating influence was gone. He felt the new administration had the political power to curtail his views, and in the process, he resulted to consult his friends in Saudi Arabia for moral, dogmatic and financial support to promote a Wahabbist interpretation of Islam centering on the rejection of mysticism, return to puritanical Islamic teaching and rejection of the then dominant Sufi brotherhoods.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1970-1980 </span>Public conflicts emerged between him and leaders of the Sufi brotherhood, some of whom he later debated on television programs. By that time, he had managed to keep his ideas in the spotlight by holding Friday talking sessions inside the Kaduna Central Mosque (Sultan Bello Mosque). Abubakar gumi who was referred to as the father of izala, succeeded in overwhelming the establishment of the 1970s organisation by name izalatul bidi'ah wa iqamatussunah co-founded by one of his prominent student.</li>
