                <li><span class="bold">1978 </span>23 Aug 1978 Kobe Bean Bryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1992-1996 </span>Kobe Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore,located in the Philadelphia surburbs of Lower Merion.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1996-1999 </span>As a rookie, Bryant mostly comes off the vench behind guardsEddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game,and also became the youngest NBA starter.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1996 </span>The Charlotte Hornets agreed to trade their no 13 pick to the La Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. He was drafted straight from high school</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1999-2002 </span>Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense  this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2002-2004 </span>The Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.In the following season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship. Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began.

                <li><span class="bold">2004-2007 </span>Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. The Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The 2005–06 season marked a crossroads in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned to coach the Lakers. Although he set many individual records, Bryant and the Lakers were unable to perform in the playoffs and were constantly eliminated during that time.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2007-2010 </span>ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority. Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that didn't take place. Aided by the trade for All-Star Pau Gasol, Bryant led his team to a West-leading 57–25 record. Bryant and the Lakers won two championships during that time including a 7 game win against the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals. Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all his five championships.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2010-2013 </span>Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total.During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to 6th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone. On April 13, 2011, the NBA fined Bryant $100,000 for directing a gay slur at referee Bennie Adams in frustration in the previous day's game. After all that Kobe's chase for a sixth Nba title eluded him as they came short in the playoffs</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2013-2015 </span>Bryant resumed practicing in November, after the season had already begun. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million. During this period Bryant was hampered with many injuries affecting the Lakers season who missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2015-2016 </span>After recovering to play in the 2015-2016 preseason, Bryant suffered another injury which made him missed final two weeks of exhibiton games. During the season Bryant announced that he would be retiring after the 2015-2016 season via the The Players' Trubune in his poem titked "Dear Basketball".</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2016-2019 </span>After retiring from his beloved game that he dedicated his whole life to, he became more invested in his family especially with his daughter Gianna who was following in his footsteps. They were seen watching games together and had a special bond through a game they both loved dearly.</li>
