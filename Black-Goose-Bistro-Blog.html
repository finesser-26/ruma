  <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>  
   <p>this is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. my Father recommends:</p>
   <p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
   <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
   <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
   <li>1 t. capers</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Instruction</h2>
 <p>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible. Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture. Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional)</p>
