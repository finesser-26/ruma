    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>posted by BGB,November 15,2012</p>
    <p>This week i am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
    <p>Location:<br>Baker's Corner,Seekonk,MA<br></p>
    <p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday,11am to midnight<br></p>
